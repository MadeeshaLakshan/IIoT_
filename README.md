### To Do
- [x] Firmware-Over-The-Air (FOTA) with github public repo, SSL
- [x] Firmware-Over-The-Air (FOTA) with github private repo, SSL
    - [x] OTA Partitions configurations
    - [x] Revert to old firmware based on event (button press/user input)
    - [x] After OTA, Getting WiFi credentials from SPIFFS ot LittleFS
- [ ] Checking AP & STA mode on ESP32 at the same time (Custom webpage for user configurations)
